          <h2>Predictive Analysis</h2>
          <p>Predictive analytics is the use of data, statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data. The goal is to go beyond knowing what has happened to providing a best assessment of what will happen in the future.</p>

          <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
          <p>Artificial intelligence today is properly known as narrow AI (or weak AI), in that it is designed to perform a narrow task (e.g. only facial recognition or only internet searches or only driving a car). However, the long-term goal of many researchers is to create general AI (AGI or strong AI). While narrow AI may outperform humans at whatever its specific task is, like playing chess or solving equations, AGI would outperform humans at nearly every cognitive task.</p>

          <h2>Deep Learning</h2>
          <p>Deep learning, a computer model learns to perform classification tasks directly from images, text, or sound. Deep learning models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, sometimes exceeding human-level performance. Models are trained by using a large set of labeled data and neural network architectures that contain many layers.</p>

          <h2>NLP</h2>
          <p>Natural language processing helps computers communicate with humans in their own language and scales other language-related tasks. For example, NLP makes it possible for computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important.</p>

            <h1>Auto Easy EDA App</h1>
            <h2>Exploratory data analysis</h2>
            <p>Benefit of EDA is to refine your selection of feature variables that will be used later for machine learning. Once you gain deep familiarity with your data set, you may need to revisit the feature engineering step – you may find the features you selected do not serve their intended purpose. Moreover you may discover other features that add to the overall picture the data presents. Once you complete the EDA stage you should have a firm feature set with which to use for supervised and unsupervised statistical learning.

In a hurry to get to the machine learning stage, some data scientists either entirely skip the exploratory process or do a very perfunctory job. This is a mistake with many implications, including generating inaccurate models, generating accurate models but on the wrong data, not creating the right types of variables in data preparation, and using resources inefficiently because of realizing only after generating models that perhaps the data is skewed, or has outliers, or has too many missing values, or finding that some values are inconsistent.

Here with the help of AUTO EASY EDA APP we can do EDA within few minutes. It saves times and most Important its just drag and dropping of files.</p>

            <p>We have created a system using Machine learning Technique to predict the personality with the handwriting. With the piece of blank paper and handwriting, we can predict the personality with the study of graphology. We have done many experiments with different kinds of stuff of machine learning and came up with our own hybrid model which has prediction accuracy up to 100% and it's not an overfit model.</p>

        <h2>Data Scientist</h2>
        <p>Hello ! I am Rahul Singh

I am scientist with big interest in how data shapes our lives. I mainly work on NLP, Deep Learning and AI.

During my scientific journey I learned a lot of concepts and developed a lot of skills, such us : Expert Systems Developments, Knowledge-based system, Data integration, data analysis, Data mining and Text Mining, Machine learning

I am curious and a compulsive scientific book buyer because I am a lifelong learner and believe that everyday there are tons of new things we can learn to be, even a bit, better than the person we were yesterday</p>
